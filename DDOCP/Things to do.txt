Reported by ghost:
Crystal Cove items still have old stats, though not much can be done until it comes back, unless people have all the individual items to report the new values

Reported by Bjond:
I like the updates for 152 -- lots of nice fixes. Got a couple more for you.

Easy: Epic & Legendary Tourney Armor should be Light, not Medium.

Harder: AC stacking is MUCH closer to matching live, but still has a couple issues.
Some things are adding to Armor Bonus and Shield Bonus that should not.
AFAIK, the only thing that adds to Armor Bonus or Shield Bonus (for the AC armor/shield multiplier bonus) is the Enhancement on the item;
eg. watch captain's plate is showing as "Armor 100% of 52" and Crystalline Ward as "Shield 135% Bonus of 54".
They should be 40=25+15 and 42=27+15, respectively. Both are too high by 12 AC for the build I checked.

7 of the 12 AC is from PLD: Divine Revelation, PLD: Sacred Armor Mastery, and Art: Armor Mastery.
These are correctly being added to Armor Class, but they shouldn't also add to Armor or Shield Bonus, too.
The last 5 AC is from base PLD, but couldn't find where (swapping PLD for Ranger got rid of it, but removing enhances, feats, destines did not).

Checked Ftr/Stalwart AC and it's not right, too: Stalwart Defensive Mastery is also being added to the Armor Bonus like the PLD & Art versions.
Stalwart's Armor & Shield Expertise are not being added at all. Those should add to the Enhancement for Armor Bonus & Shield Bonus.
And, Scion of Arborea's +2 Enhancement bonus is also not being added to the Shield.
The text calls for weapon, but it does add to shields, orbs, & rune-arm enhancement, too (not sure it matters for orbs & RAs, though).
