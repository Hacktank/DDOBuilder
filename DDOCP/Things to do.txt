Crystal Cove items still have old stats, though not much can be done until it comes back, unless people have all the individual items to report the new values

Reported by Bjond:
I like the updates for 152 -- lots of nice fixes. Got a couple more for you.

Easy: Epic & Legendary Tourney Armor should be Light, not Medium.

Harder: AC stacking is MUCH closer to matching live, but still has a couple issues.
Some things are adding to Armor Bonus and Shield Bonus that should not.
AFAIK, the only thing that adds to Armor Bonus or Shield Bonus (for the AC armor/shield multiplier bonus) is the Enhancement on the item;
eg. watch captain's plate is showing as "Armor 100% of 52" and Crystalline Ward as "Shield 135% Bonus of 54".
They should be 40=25+15 and 42=27+15, respectively. Both are too high by 12 AC for the build I checked.

7 of the 12 AC is from PLD: Divine Revelation, PLD: Sacred Armor Mastery, and Art: Armor Mastery.
These are correctly being added to Armor Class, but they shouldn't also add to Armor or Shield Bonus, too.
The last 5 AC is from base PLD, but couldn't find where (swapping PLD for Ranger got rid of it, but removing enhances, feats, destines did not).

Checked Ftr/Stalwart AC and it's not right, too: Stalwart Defensive Mastery is also being added to the Armor Bonus like the PLD & Art versions.
Stalwart's Armor & Shield Expertise are not being added at all. Those should add to the Enhancement for Armor Bonus & Shield Bonus.
And, Scion of Arborea's +2 Enhancement bonus is also not being added to the Shield.
The text calls for weapon, but it does add to shields, orbs, & rune-arm enhancement, too (not sure it matters for orbs & RAs, though).
 Luck doesn't increase skills in the planner. This is tested with a character that also had the Luck of Heroes feat and got +6 to skills ingame.


(Reported by Khalibano)
Bladeforged Artificers (with the 1 pally level removed) automatically add 2 repair spells per level in the planner.
I don't know if this is what happens in game, as I have not TRed this character into this build yet.


Druid
T3,4,5 - Nature's Protector - Ursa line's restriction updated to be usable by druids in bear form either using shield or wearing medium or heavier armor.

Additional Follow Up:

Improved Natural Fighting: Wolf form competence bonus increased from 15% to 20%.


Reported by Bjond:

Implement bonus sb 1xML to match game instead of 3xEnhancement (except for EK implement bonus and old pre-patch augmented items)   
  suspect they'll eventually patch EK to be 1xML, but they don't seem in a hurry about it

Shifter rage should not give base barbarian rage bonuses, only shifter & tree bonuses (ie. no STR+CON for wildhunt shift)

 Critical Profile is still very buggy
  Keen & Impact should be a competence bonus; it does not and should not stack with any other competence bonus
  Swash should be a competence bonus; swash range bonus should be doubled with appropriate i.crit feat & weapon
   (builder sorta tries to double, but does not: shows 2 stacks but only applies 1 stack)
   to test: ALL base swash weapons (except ONLY L.Pick) have 15x3 profile when swashbuckling with matching i.crit feat
 Vistani Double Daggers DS+20 is always inactive (looks like there's no auto-granted "TWF" mode for dual wielding)

 SF can't pick a 2nd religion (tested in game using SDK Iconic: 1 Rogue X SF X Monk)
  no extra feat slot, gotta burn a regular 1/3/6/.. feat
  feat can be taken as any class; ie. @ L1 for Paladin or any level after (tested when taking L6 as 2 monk and 4 paladin)
  you can't take a 3rd religion; tested @ L9 with 6 Pal
  religion2 is subject to normal race restrictions
