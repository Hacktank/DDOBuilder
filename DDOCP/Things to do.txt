Spell effects do not yet update on caster level changes due to epic destinies

Upgrading/downgrading an epic destiny enhancement that is twisted does not update the stacks.

rnett:
It has to be calculated anyways to show the DC. It would be nice to have the
caster level displayed for damage calculations.
Also, misic caster level effects (Arcane Augmentation, Reflection of the Wave's
elemental form buff) and elemental based caster level bonuses (Sorcerer enhancement
trees, Draconic Incarnation Dragon Spell Knowledge) currently don't show up anywhere
else, if there are even calculated.

Divine Might, Divine Will, Harper's Know the Angles, and Falconry's Deadly
Instinct's Damage components now provide an actual Insight bonus to Damage
(as their tooltips claim they do), meaning:
They all provide Damage to both Melee and Ranged attacks.
They do not stack with other Insight bonuses to Damage.
The ones that provide Attack do not stack with other Insight bonuses to Attack.


1097 (and earlier) Incorect BAB calc for BAB=Character Level
This one is pretty minor. The various abilities and spells that set
BAB=Character Level will take the effective BAB all the way to 30;
eg. Bard WC Core 4, Tensors, Divine Power, Cleric/FVS Warpriest T5,
and EK T4. They don't unlock feats, but the 30=BAB will effect attack
bonus (to-hit), attack rate (25 cap for melee, 30 for ranged), and PRR
bonus from armor.

So, I added an "export gear set to text" button with v0.5.2. It spits out the following (a tank setup I use to test) :

Eye:Legendary Collective Sight{insight Charisma 10}{enhancement Wisdom 21}
Head:Legendary Standard Issue Faceplate
Neck:Legendary Standard Issue Sigil
Body:Legendary Watch Captain's Platemail
Back:Legendary Cloak of the City's Champion
Waist:Legendary Bronze Dragonscale Belt
Finger1:Legendary Celestial Emerald Ring{enhancement Strength 21}
Finger2:Stolen Signet of ir'Wynarn
Offhand:Legendary Rising Sun

The text between curly braces are optional parameters set for the item. Not sure if DDOBuilder does something similar.
