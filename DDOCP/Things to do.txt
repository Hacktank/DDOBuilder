Support higher resolutions by providing bigger screen bitmaps in enhancement/reaper/destiny views.

Spell revocation needs to clear scrolling of control if required.

Spell effects do not yet update on caster level changes due to epic destinies

Upgrading/downgrading an epic destiny enhancement that is twisted does not update the stacks.

So, I added an "export gear set to text" button with v0.5.2. It spits out the following (a tank setup I use to test) :

Eye:Legendary Collective Sight{insight Charisma 10}{enhancement Wisdom 21}
Head:Legendary Standard Issue Faceplate
Neck:Legendary Standard Issue Sigil
Body:Legendary Watch Captain's Platemail
Back:Legendary Cloak of the City's Champion
Waist:Legendary Bronze Dragonscale Belt
Finger1:Legendary Celestial Emerald Ring{enhancement Strength 21}
Finger2:Stolen Signet of ir'Wynarn
Offhand:Legendary Rising Sun

The text between curly braces are optional parameters set for the item. Not sure if DDOBuilder does something similar.
