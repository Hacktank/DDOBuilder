        <EffectDescription>Enhanced Bloodrage: This weapon is enhanced by blood - your blood! Each time you take damage or kill an enemy, there is a small chance that you will fall into an unholy bloodrage, greatly increasing your Melee Power, Constitution, and Damage. However, this rage will leave you more vulnerable to Physical attacks, slightly reducing your Armor Class.</EffectDescription>
        <EffectDescription>Relentless Fury: While this item is equipped, any killing blows you strike against enemies may drive you into a furious rage, providing a 5% Enhancement damage bonus to your melee, ranged and unarmed attacks for 30 seconds. Slaying weaker opponents has a reduced chance of producing this effect.</EffectDescription>
